      <description>I think this is a new record for longest time between posts, sorry about that. Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that I have successfully made feeds that are automatically generated when I make a new blog (if you want to subscribe to them, they are https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/feed.json and https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/feed.rss). I will shortly add links to the blog website to facilitate copying the links. See you later!</description>

      <title>Renewed Tab</title>
      <link>https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/#Renewed_Tab</link>
      <description>I am very happy to announce that I have finished translating Renewed Tab(https://renewedtab.com) to Spanish, and it is now included in the latest version, 1.11.0. This update to Renewed Tab also fixed many bugs and added a whole load of new features. If you dont know what Renewed Tab is, it is basically a browser extension that changes the new tab page so it has beautiful backgrounds and widgets, it is also customisable. Now that I have explained what it is, I would like to recommend you, yes YOU reading this right now, to at least check it out. Renewed Tab is not only beautiful but it is also very useful, for example, if you want to focus more and just want the time on your new tab page, you can customise it so it only has the time there. I dont know what else to say about it other than that it is epic. lol.</description>

      <title>Blog finally working</title>
      <link>https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/#Blog_finally_working</link>
      <description>I am so happy this basic blog system is finally working as i have spent more than two hours trying to get it to work, more than one of those two hours was spent trying to use Github Actions to setup Node.js and install the fs(file system) package so i could make it create a new html file for each blog but that didnt seem to be working. I will briefly explain how everything is currently working(i use github pages to host this website btw), all the blogs (along with their set number, date and title) are currently stored in a csv file and that file is read and it adds all the titles to the blog page, these are actually buttons that can be clicked on. When a button is clicked, it changes the page so instead of all the blog&#39;s titles, it has the blog that you clicked on&#39;s title and date and just under that, the actual blog. To make a new blog post, i have to edit the csv file, which i admit, is a tad annoying but i can deal with it. Anyways, that is all i can think of. Thanks for reading. :) .</description>
