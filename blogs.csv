Hello World!|31 August 2021|This is my first ever blog and is sort of just a test.
Blog finally working|31 August 2021|I am so happy this basic blog system is finally working as I have spent more than two hours trying to get basic functionality, more than one of those two hours was spent trying to use Github Actions to setup Node.js and install the fs(file system) package so I could make it create a new html file for each blog but that didnt seem to be working so I tried a different approach. I will briefly explain how everything is currently working(I use github pages to host this website btw), all the blogs (along with their set number, date and title) are currently stored in a csv file and that file is read and it adds all the titles to the blog page, these are actually buttons that can be clicked on. When a button is clicked, it changes the page so instead of all the blog's titles, it has the blog that you clicked on's title and date and just under that, the actual blog. To make a new blog post, I have to edit the csv file, which I admit, is a tad annoying but I can deal with it. Anyways, that is all I can think of. Thanks for reading. :) .
Renewed Tab|15 September 2021|I am very happy to announce that I have finished translating Renewed Tab(https://renewedtab.com) to Spanish, and the translation is now included in the latest version, 1.11.0. If you dont know what Renewed Tab is, it is a browser extension that changes the new tab page so it has beautiful backgrounds and widgets, it is very customisable. I highly recommend it as I find that it is very useful, and I cant wait to see what future updates bring.
Game Jam!|11 October 2021|I want to inform you that I am participating in a 3D voxel horror game game jam that ends at the end of October. The repo is private for now but I will make it public when I have finished making it so you can try :)
Forest Ranger released!|29 October 2021|Yay! I finished my game for the 3d voxel horror game jam. It would be awesome if you could check it out (https://minetest-j45.itch.io/forest-ranger) and rate it (https://itch.io/jam/voxel-horror-jam-2021/rate/1253570). Thanks in advance!
Minetest game jam|25 December 2021|I just wanted to tell you that I participated in the 2021 Minetest game jam and I made a game inspired by Minecraft Championship's Buildmart, called Build'N'Buy and you can access it at https://content.minetest.net/packages/j45/build_n_buy/. Feel free to try it, I hope you like it.
Feeds!|6 March 2022|I just wanted to tell you that I have successfully made feeds that are automatically generated when I make a new blog post (if you want to subscribe to them, they are https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/feed.json for a JSON feed and https://j1233.minetest.land/blog/feed.rss for and RSS feed). I will shortly add links to the blog website to facilitate copying/clicking links.
Update|21 Febuary 2023|This is just a post updating you on how I will be using this blog system in the future and the changes I have made. As you may have noticed, my website has recently gone through many UI changes, this is part of my scheme to revamp my website. Along with this, I plan on changing the way my blog works, I plan on it focusing more on technology, and less about me. So far, I have deleted some parts of old posts that were cringe. Soon, I will make the blog UI more intuitive and make it include more features, such as links and images. I will also make new posts as soon as I get some ideas.
DNS over TLS|2 April 2023|This is a blog post that I have wanted to make recently, after finding very little information online about how DNS over TLS (DoT) requests are formatted. What I have learnt while researching for <a href="https://github.com/Minetest-j45/dothole">my project</a> is that DoT requests/respones only differ from normal DNS requests in one manner. <br>This difference is that the first 2 bytes of the message are the length of the rest of the message. These two length bytes are prepended to the message which is then sent with TLS. This is mentioned in the RFC, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7858.html#section-3.3">as seen here</a>, but I didnt see this at first, leading to some errors. I hope this information is useful or atleast interesting to someone out there.
